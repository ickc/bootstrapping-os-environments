Some scripts to install some packages.

# curl-bash

Some of these script is written to be curl-bash safe:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/ickc/bootstrapping-os-environments/raw/master/install/vscode_cli.sh | bash
curl -L https://github.com/ickc/bootstrapping-os-environments/raw/master/install/gh.sh | bash
```

where `zerotier.sh` is calling a curl-bash.
